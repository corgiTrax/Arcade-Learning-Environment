# Imitation learning model
- [ ] Improvement joint network architecture: remove dropouts; a better loss than KLD;
- [ ] Make the network like whatever RL algorithm we plan to use
- [ ] One frame vs four frames?
- [ ] In AIplaying modify files to allow testing the model
- [ ] Get game performance results

# Reinforcement learning model
- [ ] Pretrain and weight transfer
- [ ] DQFD + attention
- [ ] Other architectures we hypothesized
- [ ] DQN?
- [ ] A2C?
- [ ] PPO? TRPO?
